  abstract  = {Continuation, embedding or homotopy methods have long served as useful tools in modern mathematics. Their use can be traced back at least to such venerated works as those of Poincar{\'e} (1881--1886), Klein (1882--1883) and Bernstein (1910). Leray {\&} Schauder (1934) refined the tool and presented it as a global result in topology viz. the homotopy invariance of degree. The use of deformations to solve nonlinear systems of equations may be traced back at least to Lahaye (1934). The classical embedding methods may be regarded as a forerunner of the predictor-corrector methods which we will treat extensively in this book.},

  abstract = {POMULT is a FORTRAN code for locating Periodic Orbits and Equilibrium Points in Hamiltonian systems based on 2-point boundary value solvers which use multiple shooting algorithms. The code has mainly been developed for locating periodic orbits in molecular Hamiltonian systems with many degrees of freedom and it utilizes a damped Newton—Raphson method and a secant method. The Graphical User Interface has also been written in the tcl-tk script language for interactively manipulating the input and output data. POMULT provides routines for a general analysis of a dynamical system such as fast Fourier transform of the trajectories, Poincaré surfaces of sections, maximum Lyapunov exponents and evaluation of the classical autocorrelation functions and power spectra.}

  abstract = {We introduce and justify a computational scheme for the continuation of periodic orbits in systems with one or more first integrals, and in particular in Hamiltonian systems having several independent symmetries. Our method is based on a generalization of the concept of a normal periodic orbit as introduced by Sepulchre and MacKay [Nonlinearity 10 (1997) 679]. We illustrate the continuation method on some integrable Hamiltonian systems with two degrees of freedom and briefly discuss some further applications.}

  abstract = { This paper studies numerical methods for linear stability analysis of periodic solutions in codes for bifurcation analysis of small systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Popular techniques in use today (including the AUTO97 method) produce very inaccurate Floquet multipliers if the system has very large or small multipliers. These codes compute the monodromy matrix explicitly or as a matrix pencil of two matrices. The monodromy matrix arises naturally as a product of many matrices in many numerical methods, but this is not exploited. In this case, all Floquet multipliers can be computed with very high precision by using the periodic Schur decomposition and corresponding algorithm [Bojanczyk et al., 1992]. The time discretisation of the periodic orbit becomes the limiting factor for the accuracy. We present just enough of the numerical methods to show how the Floquet multipliers are currently computed and how the periodic Schur decomposition can be fitted into existing codes but omit all details. However, we show extensive test results for a few artificial matrices and for two four-dimensional systems with some very large and very small Floquet multipliers to illustrate the problems experienced by current techniques and the better results obtained using the periodic Schur decomposition. We use a modified version of AUTO97 [Doedel et al., 1997] in our experiments. }
